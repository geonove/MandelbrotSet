# Mandelbrot Set Visualizer with SFML

This project is a Mandelbrot set visualizer implemented in C++ using the SFML library. The visualization is enhanced with the use of OpenMP for parallelization and optimization.

## Requirements

Before running this project, ensure that the SFML library is installed on your computer. You can download SFML from the official website: [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project directory in a terminal or command prompt.
3. Compile the project using your preferred C++ compiler (e.g., g++) with OpenMP.
4. Run the executable file generated by the compiler.

## Usage

Upon running the program, a window will appear, displaying the intricate patterns of the Mandelbrot set. The visualization starts with an initial view of the set.

- **Left Click:** Zoom in at the cursor position.
- **Right Click:** Zoom out from the current view.

The Mandelbrot set is calculated based on the complex number associated with each pixel on the screen. Zooming in and out dynamically adjusts the viewing window, providing an interactive and visually stunning experience. The use of OpenMP ensures efficient parallelization and optimization of the computation.
